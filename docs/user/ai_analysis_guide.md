## Understanding Scores

### Scoring Formula

**Overall Score** = (Experience × 50%) + (Skills × 30%) + (Education × 20%)

*Note: Supplemental information is tracked separately and not included in overall score.*

### Category Ranges

| Category | Score Range | Meaning |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Best Match** | 90-100 | Exceptional alignment with requirements |
| **Good Match** | 70-89 | Strong qualifications, recommended for review |
| **Partial Match** | 50-69 | Some gaps, may require additional screening |
| **Mismatched** | 0-49 | Significant gaps, likely not suitable |

### Example Scores

**Candidate A:**
- Education: 85 (Master's degree)
- Skills: 90 (All required skills matched)
- Experience: 95 (7 years, exceeds 5-year requirement)
- **Overall**: floor(95×0.50 + 90×0.30 + 85×0.20) = floor(91.5) = **91** → **Best Match**

**Candidate B:**
- Education: 70 (Bachelor's degree)
- Skills: 75 (Most skills matched)
- Experience: 60 (3 years, below 5-year requirement)
- **Overall**: floor(60×0.50 + 75×0.30 + 70×0.20) = floor(66.5) = **66** → **Partial Match**

## Handling Unprocessed Applicants

**Why applicants may be Unprocessed:**
- Corrupted or password-protected PDF
- Unsupported file format
- LLM parsing failure
- Network timeout

**What to do:**
1. Check error message in results
2. Request updated resume from applicant
3. Manually review if needed
4. Re-run analysis after uploading new resume

---

## Re-running Analysis

**When to re-run:**
- New applicants have applied
- Job requirements changed
- Previous analysis had many failures

**How to re-run:**
1. Go to job detail or results page
2. Click **"Re-run Analysis"**
3. Confirm (this deletes previous results)
4. Wait for new analysis to complete

---

## Tips for Best Results

### 1. Write Clear Job Requirements
- Specify required skills explicitly
- Define experience level clearly
- Include must-have qualifications

### 2. Review Justifications
- Don't rely solely on scores
- Read AI justifications for context
- Consider edge cases (career changers, etc.)

### 3. Use Filters Effectively
- Filter by "Best Match" for top candidates
- Review "Good Match" for hidden gems
- Check "Partial Match" for transferable skills

### 4. Combine with Human Review
- Use AI scores as initial screening
- Conduct phone/video interviews
- Consider cultural fit and soft skills

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Job Still Active" Error
**Solution**: Wait for job to expire or manually deactivate it.

### "No Applicants" Error
**Solution**: Wait for applicants to apply before starting analysis.

### Analysis Taking Too Long
**Expected Time**: ~6 seconds per applicant (10 resumes/minute)
**If slower**: Check Ollama server status and network connectivity.

### High Unprocessed Rate
**Solutions**:
- Ensure resumes are PDF or DOCX format
- Check that files are not password-protected
- Verify Ollama server is running
